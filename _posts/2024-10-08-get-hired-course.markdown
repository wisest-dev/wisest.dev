I'm launching a new course
"How to Stand Out and Get Hired as a Junior Software Engineer"
The course starts **on 17 October** and is for both software developers and test automation engineers.

I have planned the course in a new, exciting format that is easy to follow.
I challenge the participants to take small, concrete steps to help them improve their skills,
stand out from the competition, and land that first job.

The course consists of four parts. Each part is live on Thursday at 7 pm Eastern European time.
And, of course, it is possible to watch the recording.
But people attending the live session get to ask questions I answer the following week.
